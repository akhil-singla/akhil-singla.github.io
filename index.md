Akhil Singla is a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences (IEMS) at Northwestern University. Currently, I am working with Professor Sanjay Mehrotra on optimizing diagnostic operations and treatment control decisions for kidney transplant patients. I earned my PhD from IEMS in August 2024 under the supervision of Professor Seyed Iravani. My research interests focus on the design and control of supply chains and service operations, leveraging tools such as dynamic programming, game theory, and data-driven analysis.
