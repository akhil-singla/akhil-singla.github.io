#### <u>Optimal Control of Join Decision in Fork-Join Queues</u>
*Co-authors: Seyed Iravani (IEMS)*

Status: Submitted

In fork-join (FJ) queues, each incoming job to the system is copied and sent to all its parallel servers. A job is completed when *all* or *some* of the copies are processed by servers. These FJ queues are prevalent in diverse domains of service operations like fact-checking for social media platforms, hospital diagnosis operations, legal systems etc. FJ queueing systems can capture the trade-off between speed and accuracy that commonly arises in knowledge-based service systems in which processing a job also involves evaluation of knowledge servers leading to a decision. While literature on performance analysis of FJ queues is large, the optimal control of FJ queues are not well studied. In this paper, we study the optimal control of "join decision" in FJ queues. A join decision determines how many copies of a job should be processed before the job leaves the system. We fully characterize the structure of the optimal dynamic join decision policy with respect to the parameters that affect the trade-off between speed and accuracy. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we propose an intuitive, easy-to-compute and easy-to-implement heuristic policy that uses total number of jobs in the system to make join decision. This heuristic is shown to perform within 2% optimality gap and performs better than some commonly used benchmark policies. The heuristic policy also allows managers to achieve a desired service levels that balances speed and accuracy of the operations.


#### <u>Tactical and Strategic Risks from Disruptions in Competing Supply Chainss</u>
*Co-authors: Wallce Hopp (Ross), Seyed Iravani (IEMS)*

Status: Working paper

Supply chain disruptions can lead to both tactical (i.e., loss of short-term sales during disruption) and strategic (i.e., loss of long-term market share) consequences. In this paper, we model the impact of regional supply disruptions on competing supply chains where two firms compete for the limited backup supply. We describe generic strategies for both firms in a two-stage game of: (i) *Preparation*, which involves investment prior to a disruption in securing backup supply, and (ii) *Response*, which involves post-disruption purchase of the secured backup supply for a component whose availability has been compromised. Firms maximize their long-run profit while simultaneously deciding their preparation and response strategies. We find the equilibrium strategy for firms in the two stages of the game. We characterize conditions under which a firm can use its preparation investment to not only minimize its disruption risks, but also capture more market shares. Our game-theoretic model also helps to measure the firm's risk exposure by estimating the benefit of preparation for a firm. We identify top factors that influence the firm's preparation investment and impact its customers satisfaction. We show that the choice of the top factors depends on the size of the firm and length of the disruption. We also demonstrate conditions under which a firm should focus on protecting market shares versus exploiting disruption to gain competitor's market share. 


#### <u>Optimal Product Launch and Innovation Investment Decisions for a Niche Firm</u>
*Co-authors: Izak Duenyas (Ross), Seyed Iravani (IEMS), Jackie Ng Lane (HBS)*

Status: Working paper

We consider the product launch and innovation investment decisions for a niche firm that produces a single product in the presence of a multi-product rival firm. The rival continuously launches its new product generations, which increases its competitive advantage compared to the niche product, consequently reducing the niche firm's revenue. However, to gain higher revenues, the niche firm may launch its R\&D product into the market by incurring a launch cost, or, to gain a competitive advantage against the rival, the niche firm may innovate by investing in R\&D technology improvements. The novel aspect of this problem is that the niche firm’s product is an auxiliary or peripheral part of a multi-product firm’s business; therefore, only the niche firm views the multi-product firm as a direct competitor. We develop a dynamic programming model to analyze the niche firm’s decisions on when to launch and how to innovate, incorporating stochastic innovation gains. We characterize the structure of the optimal launch decision policy and study its sensitivity with respect to model parameters. Due to non-monotonicity in the structure of the optimal policy driven by the innovation investment decisions, we partially characterize the optimal policy that informs the joint product launch and innovation investment decisions. We propose a triple-threshold policy that performs very close to the optimal solution and performs significantly better than the commonly used policies. We also identify the conditions under which the commonly used policy to launch the product after fixed time intervals can incur huge costs for the firm.


#### <u>Price Markdowns to Induce Customers to Opt Out of Free Returns</u>
*Co-authors: Sajjad Najaffi (HEC Paris), Izak Duenyas (Ross)*

Status: Under Review

With consumers increasingly relying on online shopping, returns have become a considerable issue in the retail e-commerce industry.  The main paradigm among giant e-retailers is to sell a product with either "free returns" or "partial refund". In such policies, the return policy associated with each product is *imposed* upon customers---that is, a product either comes with a free return or partial refund. In this paper we study a flexible return policy in which customers get to *self-select* return options. We consider a setting where alongside the conventional free return option, consumers are offered an additional return alternative called *opt-out of free return* (FO). If the free return option is chosen by consumers, they can return the purchased item over a predetermined grace period for a full refund. However, if consumers forego free return and self-select FO, the firm offers them a price markdown. If the consumers pick this option, they can still return the product during the grace period, but they will have to pay a fixed penalty and a variable penalty proportional to the product's purchase price. We aim to derive managerial insights on *when* offering FO would be beneficial to firms, and if they offer it, *how* the firm can set the optimal markdown level. (i) We find that the uncertainty level in the consumers' valuation distribution has a subtle impact on the profitability of providing the FO option alongside the free returns. While conventional wisdom suggests that offering the FO option is more likely to be beneficial as customers' uncertainty about the product's valuation pre-purchase increases, we show that the opposite could be true. Specifically, we show that if the product's *expected valuation* is high (resp. low), higher (resp. lower) uncertainty in the valuation distribution makes it more likely that offering FO alongside FR is advantageous to the firm. (ii) We also examine how the profitability of the FO option is affected when the product's valuation (stochastically) decreases. We find that the salvage value of returns plays a crucial role in how the firm can benefit from offering the FO option as the product's valuation decreases. Specifically, offering FO along with FR is more likely to be beneficial as consumers' valuation decreases if the salvage value of a returned product is sufficiently small.
