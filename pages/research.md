#### <u>Optimal Control of Join Decision in Fork-Join Queues</u>
*In fork-join (FJ) queues, each incoming job to the system is copied and sent to all its parallel servers. A job is completed when \textit{all} or \textit{some} of the copies are processed by servers. These FJ queues are prevalent in diverse domains of service operations like fact-checking for social media platforms, hospital diagnosis operations, legal systems etc. FJ queueing systems can capture the trade-off between speed and accuracy that commonly arises in knowledge-based service systems in which processing a job also involves evaluation of knowledge servers leading to a decision. While literature on performance analysis of FJ queues is large, the optimal control of FJ queues are not well studied. In this paper, we study the optimal control of ``join decision" in FJ queues. A join decision determines how many copies of a job should be processed before the job leaves the system. We fully characterize the structure of the optimal dynamic join decision policy with respect to the parameters that affect the trade-off between speed and accuracy. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we propose an intuitive, easy-to-compute and easy-to-implement heuristic policy that uses total number of jobs in the system to make join decision. This heuristic is shown to perform within 2\% optimality gap and performs better than some commonly used benchmark policies. The heuristic policy also allows managers to achieve a desired service levels that balances speed and accuracy of the operations.*
